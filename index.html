      The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (commonly called the
      Coachella Festival or simply Coachella) is an annual music and arts
      festival held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, in the
      Coachella Valley in the Colorado Desert. It was co-founded by Paul Tollett
      and Rick Van Santen in 1999, and is organized by Goldenvoice, a subsidiary
      of AEG Presents.[1] The event features musical artists from many genres of
      music, including rock, pop, indie, hip hop and electronic dance music, as
      well as art installations and sculptures. Across the grounds, several
      stages continuously host live music. The main stages are the: Coachella
      Stage, Outdoor Theatre, Gobi Tenat, Mojave Tent, and Sahara Tent; a
      smaller Oasis Dome was used in 2006 and 2011, while a new Yuma stage was
      introduced in 2013 and a Sonora stage in 2017.

      The festival's origins trace back to a 1993 concert that Pearl Jam
      performed at the Empire Polo Club while boycotting venues controlled by
      Ticketmaster. The show validated the site's viability for hosting large
      events, leading to the inaugural Coachella Festival being held over the
      course of two days in October 1999, three months after Woodstock '99.
      After no event was held in 2000, Coachella returned on an annual basis
      beginning in April 2001 as a single-day event. In 2002, the festival
      reverted to a two-day format. Coachella was expanded to a third day in
      2007 and eventually a second weekend in 2012; it is now held on
      consecutive three-day weekends in April, with the same lineup each
      weekend. Organizers began permitting spectators to camp on the grounds in
      2003, one of several expansions and additions in the festival's history.

    Coachella showcases popular and established musical artists as well as emerging artists and reunited groups. It is one of the largest, most famous, and most profitable music festivals in the United States and the world.[3][4] Each Coachella staged from 2013 to 2015 set new records for festival attendance and gross revenues. The 2017 festival was attended by 250,000 people and grossed $114.6 million. Coachella's success led to Goldenvoice establishing additional music festivals at the site, including the annual Stagecoach country music festival beginning in 2007.
